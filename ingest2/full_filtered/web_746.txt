In this article I detail what heart disease is, what the risks of heart disease are, what causes heart disease, the tests available to test for heart disease and the many treatment options available for heart disease. What is it? Heart Disease refers to a number of diseases that affect your heart, and in some cases, your blood vessels. The various diseases that fall under the umbrella of Heart Disease include diseases of your blood vessels, such as Coronary Artery Disease ; heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias) ; and heart defects you're born with ( Congenital Heart Defects ). How do I recognise it? Heart Disease symptoms vary, depending on what type of Heart Disease you have. Symptoms of Heart Disease in your blood vessels (Cardiovascular Disease) Chest pain (Angina) Shortness of breath Pain, numbness, weakness or coldness in your legs or arms, if the blood vessels in those parts of your body are narrowed Heart Disease symptoms caused by abnormal heartbeats (Heart Arrhythmias) A fluttering in your chest A racing heartbeat ( Tachycardia ) A slow heartbeat ( Bradycardia ) Chest pain Shortness of breath Lightheadedness Dizziness Fainting (syncope) or near fainting Heart Disease symptoms caused by Heart Defects Serious congenital Heart Defects — a defect you're born with — usually become evident during the first few hours, days, weeks and months of life. Heart Defect symptoms could include: Pale gray or blue skin color (cyanosis) Swelling in the legs, abdomen or areas around the eyes Shortness of breath during feedings, leading to poor weight gain Less-serious congenital Heart Defects are often not diagnosed until later in childhood, or even adulthood. Signs and symptoms of Congenital Heart Defects that usually aren't immediately life-threatening include: Easily becoming short of breath during exercise or activity Easily tiring during exercise or activity Built-up fluid in the heart or lungs Swelling in the hands, ankles or feet Heart Disease symptoms caused by thick heart muscle (Cardiomyopathy) Breathlessness with exertion or even at rest Swelling of the legs, ankles and feet Bloating (distention) of the abdomen with fluid Fatigue Irregular heartbeats that feel rapid, pounding or fluttering Dizziness , lightheadedness and fainting Heart Disease symptoms caused by heart infections Fever Shortness of breath Weakness or fatigue Swelling in your legs or abdomen Changes in your heart rhythm Dry or persistent cough Skin rashes or unusual spots Heart Disease symptoms caused by valvular heart disease Fatigue Shortness of breath Irregular heartbeat or heart murmur Swollen feet or ankles Chest pain Fainting (syncope) Causes The causes of Heart Disease vary by type of Heart Disease.
