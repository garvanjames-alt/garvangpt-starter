What is it? Asthma is a condition in which your airways have a tendancy to swell up and produce extra mucous. When they do this breathing becomes difficult. How do I recognise it? Most patients will complain of some/all of these: Trouble sleeping caused by shortness of breath, coughing or wheezing An audible whistling or wheezing sound when exhaling (wheezing is a common sign of asthma in children) Shortness of breath Chest tightness or pain Bouts of coughing or wheezing that are worsened by a respiratory virus such as a cold or the flu Causes We can't say why some people get Asthma&nbsp;and others don't, but it's probably due to a combination of environmental and genetic (inherited) factors. Exposure to different allergens and irritants can trigger signs and symptoms of Asthma, including: Airborne allergens , such as pollen, animal dander, mold, cockroaches and dust mites Respiratory infections, such as the common cold Physical activity (exercise induced asthma) Cold air Air pollutants and irritants, such as smoke Certain medications, including beta blockers , aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs Strong emotions and stress Sulfites, preservatives added to some types of foods and beverages Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD) , a condition in which stomach acids back up into your throat Menstrual cycle in some women Allergic reactions to some foods, such as peanuts or shellfish How do you treat it?
