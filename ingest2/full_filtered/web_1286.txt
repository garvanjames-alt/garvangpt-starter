These are forms of the main female sex hormones, oestrogen and progesterone. Estradiol is a naturally occuring form of oestrogen and drospirenone is a synthetic form of progesterone. What is Angeliq used for? Hormone replacement therapy to relieve symptoms of the menopause. Second-line option for preventing osteoporosis in postmenopausal women who are at high risk of fractures and cannot take other medicines licensed for preventing osteoporosis . How does Angeliq work? Angeliq tablets contain two active ingredients, estradiol and drospirenone. These are forms of the main female sex hormones, oestrogen and progesterone. Estradiol is a naturally occuring form of oestrogen and drospirenone is a synthetic form of progesterone. Women's ovaries gradually produce less and less oestrogen in the period up to the menopause , and oestrogen blood levels decline as a result. The declining levels of oestrogen can cause distressing symptoms, such as irregular periods, hot flushes , night sweats, mood swings and vaginal dryness or itching. Oestrogen (in this case in the form of estradiol) can be given as a supplement to replace the falling levels in the body and help reduce these distressing symptoms of the menopause . This is known as hormone replacement therapy (HRT). HRT is usually only required for short-term relief from menopausal symptoms and its use should be reviewed at least once a year with your doctor. A progestogen (in this case in the form of drospirenone) is needed as part of HRT for women who have not had a hysterectomy. This is because in women with an intact womb, oestrogen stimulates the growth of the womb lining (endometrium), which can lead to endometrial cancer if the growth is unopposed. A progestogen is given to oppose oestrogen's effect on the womb lining. This reduces the risk of cancer, though it does not eliminate this risk entirely. This is known as combined HRT. Angeliq is a continuous form of combined HRT. Each tablet contains both estradiol and drospirenone, so that a dose of both hormones is taken daily. This type of HRT does not produce a monthly bleed, and so is more suitable for women whose periods have already stopped, eg for postmenopausal women who have not had a period for at least 12 months. HRT is also sometimes used to prevent osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. The declining level of oestrogen at menopause can affect the bones, causing them to become thinner and more prone to breaking. Oestrogen supplements help prevent bone loss and fractures that may occur in women in the years after menopause. How do I take Angeliq tablets? One Angeliq tablet should be taken once a day on a continuous basis with no breaks between packs. Your need for continued HRT should be reviewed with your doctor at least once a year. The tablets should be swallowed whole with a drink. They can be taken either with or without food. Your tablet should be taken at around the same time each day; this will help you remember to take it. If you forget to take a dose at your usual time you should take it as soon as you remember, unless it is nearly time for your next dose. In this case you should just leave out the forgotten dose and take your next dose as usual at your usual time. Don't take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. Important information about Angeliq This medicine will not usually cause a monthly menstrual bleed. However, you may experience spotting or breakthrough bleeding during the first few months of treatment. Forgetting or missing a dose may increase the likelihood of breakthrough bleeding. If any bleeding continues after a few months of taking the medicine, or after stopping treatment, you should consult your doctor. Women taking any form of HRT should have regular medical and gynaecological check-ups. Your need for continued HRT should be reviewed with your doctor at least once a year. It is important to be aware that all women using HRT have an increased risk of being diagnosed with breast cancer compared with women who don't use HRT. This risk needs to be weighed against the personal benefits to you of taking HRT. Women on HRT should have regular breast examinations and mammograms and should examine their own breasts regularly. Report any changes in your breasts to your doctor or nurse. It is important to be aware that women using HRT have a slightly increased risk of stroke and of blood clots forming in the veins (eg deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism) compared with women who don't use HRT. The risk is higher if you have existing risk factors (eg personal or family history of blood clots, smoking, obesity, certain blood disorders) and needs to be weighed against the personal benefits to you of taking HRT. Discuss these with your doctor before starting treatment. The risk of blood clots forming in the veins (thromboembolism) while taking HRT may be temporarily increased if you experience major trauma, have surgery, or are immobile for prolonged periods of time (this includes travelling for over three hours). For this reason, your doctor may recommend that you stop taking HRT for a period of time (usually four to six weeks) prior to any planned surgery, particularly abdominal surgery or orthopaedic surgery on the lower limbs, or if you are to be immobile for long periods. The risk of blood clots during long journeys may be reduced by appropriate exercise during the journey and possibly by wearing elastic hosiery. Discuss this with your doctor.

The following medicines may potentially reduce the blood level and effect of this medicine, which could cause irregular menstrual bleeding or your symptoms to come back: aprepitant bosentan barbiturates carbamazepine cobicistat crizotinib dabrafenib efavirenz eslicarbazepine fosaprepitant fosphenytoin modafinil nevirapine oxcarbazepine phenobarbital phenytoin primidone rifabutin rifampicin ritonavir rufinamide telaprevir the herbal remedy St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) topiramate vemurafenib.

Estradiol may oppose and drospirenone may increase the effect of medicines used to lower high blood pressure. Your blood pressure will usually be checked periodically while you are taking HRT, but this is particularly important if you are also taking medicines for high blood pressure. Estradiol may oppose and drospirenone may increase the fluid-losing effect of diuretic medicines. This medicine may decrease the amount of the antiepileptic medicine lamotrigine in the blood. As this could increase the risk of seizures coming back or getting worse, the medicine may not be recommended for women who take lamotrigine on its own for epilepsy. This medicine may increase the blood levels of the following medicines and this could possibly increase the risk of their side effects: aminophylline ropinirole selegiline theophylline tizanidine. In some people (usually those with kidney problems or diabetes) drospirenone may cause an increase in the amount of potassium in your blood. There may be an increased risk of this if Angeliq is taken in combination with any of the following, which can also cause a rise in blood potassium levels: ACE inhibitors, eg enalapril, captopril, lisinopril angiotensin II antagonists, eg losartan, valsartan ciclosporin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), eg ibuprofen, indometacin, diclofenac potassium salts, eg potassium citrate for cystitis potassium-containing salt substitutes, eg Lo-Salt potassium-sparing diuretics, eg amiloride, spironolactone, triamterene potassium supplements. If you are taking any of the above, you should have a blood test during your first month of treatment with Angeliq to check your blood potassium level has not risen, particularly if you also have any kidney problems.
