Cetrine works by preventing the actions of histamine. How does Cetrine work? Cetrine&nbsp; allergy &nbsp;relief tablets contain the active ingredient cetirizine, which is a type of medicine called a non-sedating &nbsp;antihistamine .&nbsp;Cetrine works by preventing the actions of&nbsp;histamine. Histamine&nbsp;is a substance produced by the body as part of its defence mechanisms. It is stored in cells called mast cells, in almost all tissues of the body. When the body reacts to a foreign substance (known as an allergen, eg flower pollen), the mast cells are stimulated by the allergen and release their stores of&nbsp;histamine. The released&nbsp;histamine&nbsp;then binds to its receptors (H1 receptors), causing a chain reaction that results in&nbsp; allergic symptoms . It causes an increase in blood flow to the area of the&nbsp; allergy, &nbsp;and the release of other chemicals that add to the&nbsp; allergic response . All this results in the symptoms of an&nbsp; allergic reaction . In hayfever,&nbsp; histamine &nbsp;causes inflammation of the nose, eyes, skin or airways and results in itchy watery eyes, a runny nose, sneezing and nasal congestion. Cetrine works by blocking&nbsp;histamine H1 receptors. It does not prevent the actual release of&nbsp; histamine &nbsp;from mast cells, but prevents it binding to its receptors. This in turn prevents the release of other&nbsp; allergy &nbsp;chemicals and reduces the blood supply to the area, providing relief from the typical symptoms of&nbsp; hayfever. Cetrine can also be used to relieve the symptoms of a condition called chronic idiopathic urticaria. This is a chronic&nbsp; itchy &nbsp;rash, similar to nettle rash, but with no apparent cause. Blocking the actions of&nbsp; histamine&nbsp; relieves the itching and reduces the rash associated with this condition. Cetrine is called a&nbsp; non-sedating antihistamine&nbsp; as it does not enter the brain, and is therefore unlikely to cause drowsiness. However, some people may experience some slight drowsiness. What is Cetrine used for? Hayfever (seasonal allergic rhinitis) &nbsp;in adults and children aged six years and over. Inflammation of the nasal lining due to allergies that occur thoughout the year (perennial allergic rhinitis) in adults and children aged six years and over.
