It surprises many to find out it can occur in both women and men, but is far more common in women. What is it? Breast cancer is cancer that forms in the cells of the breasts. How do I recognise it? Symptoms may include: A breast lump or thickening that feels different from the surrounding tissue Bloody discharge from the nipple Change in the size or shape of a breast Changes to the skin over the breast, such as dimpling Inverted nipple Peeling or flaking of the nipple skin Redness or pitting of the skin over your breast, like the skin of an orange Causes Scientists have identified things that may increase your risk of breast cancer. But it's not clear why some people who have no risk factors develop cancer, yet other people with risk factors never do. It's likely that breast cancer is caused by a complex combination of your genetic makeup and your environment. How do you treat it? Like any disease, even if there is no cure, there is almost always something you can do to manage it and take control.
