Why have I been prescribed Ebixa? Ebixa is a drug prescribed to treat moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease. How does it work? It blocks the effects of a chemical (glutamate) in the brain which is thought to be involved in brain dysfunction. When and how do I take it? Ebixa should be taken once or twice a day, depending on the dose decided by your doctor, and should be taken at the same time every day. The film-coated tablets can be taken with or without food with plenty of water . What’s the dose? Start at 5mg a day and increase to a max of 20mg a day (in two doses of 10mg). Could they interact with other tablets? Ebixa can interact with other medications like L-dopa, dopaminergic agonists, and anticholinergics, barbiturates and neuroleptics, antispasmodic agents, dantrolene or baclofen, amantadine, cimetidine, ranitidine, procainamide, quinidine, quinine and nicotine. Because of this, always tell your doctor that you are taking Ebixa. Herbal supplements should be used with caution and only after informing your doctor first.
