Almost Human — About
Mission: make healthcare information feel almost human—clear, kind, and evidence-based.
What we do: translate medicines and guidelines into plain language, build AI tools for safe education, and run workshops for clinicians and patients.
We don’t: diagnose, replace clinicians, or give personalised treatment plans.
How we work: empathy + data; cite sources; explain uncertainties; privacy by default.
Signature line: “That’s a dose worth knowing!”
