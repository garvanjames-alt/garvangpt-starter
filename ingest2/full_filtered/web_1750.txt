Bystat (Pravastatin) is used in 3 situations: In the treatment of&nbsp;high levels of cholesterol&nbsp;and fats in the blood Bystat is used to lower high levels of “bad”&nbsp;cholesterol&nbsp;and to raise the levels of “good”&nbsp;cholesterol&nbsp;in the blood when changes to diet and exercise have failed to adequately do this. In the prevention of&nbsp;heart and blood vessel diseases • If you have high levels of&nbsp;cholesterol&nbsp;in your blood and risk factors favouring these diseases (if you smoke, are&nbsp; overweight, &nbsp;if you have&nbsp;high blood sugar&nbsp;levels or&nbsp;high blood pressure,&nbsp;if you take little exercise), Lipostat is used to reduce the risk of you having&nbsp;heart and blood vessel diseases&nbsp;and to lower your risk of dying from these diseases. • If you have already had a&nbsp; stroke &nbsp;or if you have pains in the chest (unstable&nbsp; angina) , and even if you have normal&nbsp;cholesterol levels, Lipostat is used to reduce the risk of you having another&nbsp; heart attack &nbsp;or&nbsp; stroke &nbsp;in the future, and to lower your risk of dying from these diseases. After organ transplants If you have had an organ transplant and receive medication to prevent your body rejecting the transplant, Bystat is used to reduce increased levels of fats in the blood. How does it work? The drug in Bystat&nbsp;belongs to a family of drugs called statins. It prevents the production of&nbsp; cholesterol &nbsp;by the liver and consequently reduces the levels of&nbsp; cholesterol &nbsp;and other fats (triglycerides) in your body. When and how do I take it? Bystat can be taken with or without food, with half a glass of water in the evening. What’s the dose? Adults: In the treatment of&nbsp;high levels of cholesterol&nbsp;and fats in the blood: the usual dose is 10-40 mg once a day, preferably in the evening. In the prevention of&nbsp;heart and blood vessel diseases: the usual dose is 40 mg once a day, preferably in the evening. The maximum daily dose of 40 mg of Bystat should not be exceeded. Your doctor shall tell you which dose suits you. Children (8-13 years) and adolescents (14-18 years) with a hereditary disease which increases the level of cholesterol in the blood: The usual dose is 10-20 mg once a day between 8 and 13 years and from 10 to 40 mg once a day between 14 and 18 years. After organ transplant: Your doctor may prescribe a starting dose of 20 mg once a day. The dose may be adjusted up to 40 mg&nbsp;by your doctor. Could it interact with other tablets? When combined with this treatment, the medicines stated below may result in an increased risk of developing muscle problems (see Possible side effects). It is important that you inform your doctor whether you are already being treated with: &nbsp;a medicine which lowers the&nbsp;cholesterol&nbsp;level in the blood (fibrates, e.g. gemfibrozil, fenofibrate); &nbsp;a medicine which lowers the body’s immune defences (cyclosporin); &nbsp;a medicine which treats the infections caused by bacteria (an antibiotic such as&nbsp; erythromycin &nbsp;or&nbsp; clarithromycin ); &nbsp;another medicine which lowers the level of&nbsp;cholesterol&nbsp;in your blood (nicotinic acid). If you are also using a medicine which lowers the level of fat in your blood (of the resin-type such as colestyramine), this treatment should be taken at least one hour before or four hours after you have taken the resin. This is because the resin can affect the absorption of Lipostat if the two medicines are taken too closely together. Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using or have recently used other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription Herbal supplements should be used with caution and only after informing your doctor first. What are the possible risks or side-effects? Stop taking Bystat and tell your doctor immediately if you develop any unexplained or persistent muscle pain, tenderness, weakness, or cramps, especially, if at the same time you feel unwell or have a high temperature. In very rare cases, muscle problems can be serious (rhabdomylosis) and can lead to a serious, lifethreatening&nbsp; kidney disease . Sudden severe&nbsp; allergic reactions &nbsp;including swelling of the face, lip, tongue or wind pipe which can cause great difficulty in breathing. This is a very rare reaction which can be serious if it occurs. You should tell your doctor immediately if it happens. The following side effects are uncommon and may affect more than 1 out of 1,000 persons: Effects on nervous system:&nbsp; dizziness, &nbsp; tiredness, &nbsp; headache &nbsp;or&nbsp; sleep disturbances ; Effects on vision: blurred or double vision; Digestive effects: indigestion, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain or discomfort,&nbsp; diarrhoea &nbsp;or&nbsp; constipation &nbsp;and wind; Effects on skin and hair:&nbsp; itching , pimples,&nbsp; hives, &nbsp; rashes , scalp and hair problems (including hair loss); Urinary and genital effects:&nbsp; bladder problems &nbsp;(painful or more frequent urination, having to pass water at night) and&nbsp;sexual difficulties; Effects on muscles and joints: muscle and joint pain. Can I drink alcohol while taking it? You should keep your alcohol intake to a minimum. What if I’m pregnant/breastfeeding? Bystat&nbsp;cannot be given while pregnant or during breast feeding.
