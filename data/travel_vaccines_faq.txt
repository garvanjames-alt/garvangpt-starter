Q: Which vaccines should I consider before travel?
A: It depends on destination, activities, and length of stay. Make sure routine vaccines are up to date. Common travel vaccines: Hepatitis A (widespread), Typhoid (long stays or rural areas), Hepatitis B (medical care/sexual exposure risk), Yellow fever (some countries require proof), Rabies (remote travel/animal exposure). Malaria prevention is medicine, not a vaccine. See a travel clinic ideally 6–8 weeks before departure. Local requirements vary—always check official guidance for your destination.
