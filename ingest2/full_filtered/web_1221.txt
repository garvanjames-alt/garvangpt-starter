Pancreatic Cancer begins in the tissues of your pancreas — an organ in your abdomen that lies horizontally behind the lower part of your stomach. Your pancreas secretes enzymes that aid digestion and hormones that help regulate the metabolism of sugars. Pancreatic Cancer often has a poor prognosis, even when diagnosed early. Pancreatic Cancer typically spreads rapidly and is seldom detected in its early stages, which is a major reason why it's a leading cause of cancer death. Signs and symptoms may not appear until Pancreatic Cancer is quite advanced and surgical removal isn't possible. How do I recognise it? Signs and symptoms of Pancreatic Cancer often don't occur until the disease is advanced. When signs and symptoms do appear, they may include: Upper abdominal pain that may radiate to your back Yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice) Loss of appetite Weight loss Depression Blood clots Causes It's not clear what causes Pancreatic Cancer. How do you treat it? Like any disease, even if there is no cure, there is almost always something you can do to manage it and take control.
