Q: Who should get protected against RSV?
A: Policies vary by country. Common approaches: older adults (often ≥60–75) may be offered RSV vaccination; pregnant people may receive maternal RSV vaccination at a specified gestational window to protect newborns; and infants may be offered long-acting antibody (e.g., nirsevimab) before their first RSV season. Eligibility, timing, and products differ—check current local public-health guidance.
