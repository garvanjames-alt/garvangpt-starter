What is it? Blood pressure is determined by the amount of blood your heart pumps and the amount of resistance to blood flow in your arteries. The more blood your heart pumps and the narrower your arteries, the higher your blood pressure. High blood pressure typically develops over many years, and it affects nearly everyone eventually. Fortunately, high blood pressure can be easily detected. And once you know you have high blood pressure, you can work with your doctor to control it. How do I recognise it? Most people with high blood pressure have no signs or symptoms, even if blood pressure readings reach dangerously high levels. Although a few people with early-stage high blood pressure may have dull headaches, dizzy spells or a few more nosebleeds than normal, these signs and symptoms typically don't occur until high blood pressure has reached an advanced — even life-threatening — stage. Causes There are two types of high blood pressure. Primary (essential) Hypertension In 90 to 95 percent of high blood pressure cases in adults, there's no identifiable cause. This type of high blood pressure, called essential Hypertension or Primary Hypertension, tends to develop gradually over many years. Secondary Hypertension The other 5 to 10 percent of high blood pressure cases are caused by an underlying condition. This type of high blood pressure, called secondary hypertension, tends to appear suddenly and cause higher blood pressure than does Primary Hypertension. Various conditions and medications can lead to secondary hypertension, including: Kidney abnormalities Tumors of the adrenal gland Certain Congenital Heart Defects Certain medications, such as birth control pills, cold remedies, decongestants, over-the-counter pain relievers and some prescription drugs Illegal drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines&nbsp; How do you treat it? Like any disease, even if there is no cure, there is almost always something you can do to manage it and take control. There are three main areas involved in the treatment of any disease: Conventional medicines Complementary medicines Complementary therapies For information on medicines and therapies relevant to Hypertension, make an appointment at Lynch's pharmacy, Broadale, Douglas, Cork on 021-4366923.
