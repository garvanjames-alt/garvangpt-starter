Diflazole is used to treat infections caused by fungus, which can invade any part of the body including the mouth, throat, oesophagus, lungs, bladder, genital area, and the blood. What is Diflazole? Diflazole is also used to prevent fungal infection in people with weak immune system&nbsp;caused by&nbsp; cancer &nbsp;treatment, bone marrow transplant, or diseases such as&nbsp; AIDS . Diflazole may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide. Before taking Diflazole Do not use Diflazole if you are&nbsp; allergic &nbsp;to fluconazole, or similar drugs such as clotrimazole, econazole, ketoconazole (Nizoral), miconazole, sertaconazole, sulconazole, terconazole, tioconazole, or voriconazole. You should not use Diflazole if you are also taking cisapride (Propulsid). To make sure you can safely take Diflazole, tell your doctor if you have any of these other conditions: liver disease ; kidney disease ; a&nbsp; heart rhythm&nbsp; disorder; or a personal or family history of Long QT syndrome. Do not take more than 1 dose of Diflazole if you are pregnant. Long-term use of Diflazole can harm an unborn baby or cause birth defects. Use effective birth control, and tell your doctor if you become pregnant during treatment. A single dose of Diflazole taken to treat a vaginal yeast infection is not expected to harm an unborn baby. Diflazole can pass into breast milk and may harm a nursing baby. Do not use Diflazole without telling your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby. How to take Diflazole Before starting this treatment, read the manufacturer's printed information leaflet from inside the pack. The leaflet will give you more information about the specific brand of fluconazole you have been given, and any possible side-effects from taking it. Take Diflazole exactly as your doctor has told you. Your doctor or&nbsp;pharmacist&nbsp;will tell you how much to take and when to take it. Your dose will also be on the label of the pack. Diflazole can be taken at any time of day, and can be taken either before or after a meal. Diflazole is taken as a single 150 mg capsule to treat vaginal thrush. Swallow the capsule with a drink of water. If you have been prescribed a course of Diflazole, you should keep taking the capsules or liquid each day until the course is finished, unless you are told to stop. The length of the course you have been prescribed will depend on the type of infection you have, but is likely to range from seven days to several weeks. If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If you do not remember until the following day, skip the missed dose. Do not take two doses together to make up for a forgotten dose. What happens if I miss a dose? Take the missed dose as soon as you remember. Skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose. Do not take extra medicine to make up the missed dose. Diflazole side effects Get emergency medical help if you have any of these signs of an&nbsp; allergic reaction &nbsp;to Diflazole:&nbsp; hives; &nbsp;difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.
