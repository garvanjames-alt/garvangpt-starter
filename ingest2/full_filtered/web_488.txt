Some typical symptoms of Type 1 Diabetes and Type 2 Diabetes are: Increased thirst Frequent urination Extreme hunger Unexplained weight loss Fatigue Blurred vision Slow-healing sores Frequent infections, such as gum or skin infections and vaginal or bladder infections Type 1 Diabetes usually occurs in childhood/adolescence, Type 2 Diabetes can occur at any age and is often preventable.
