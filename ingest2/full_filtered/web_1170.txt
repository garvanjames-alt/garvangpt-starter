Menopause is a natural biological process, not a medical illness. Even so, the physical and emotional symptoms of Menopause can disrupt your sleep, sap your energy and — at least indirectly — trigger feelings of sadness and loss. Hormonal changes cause the physical symptoms of Menopause, but mistaken beliefs about the Menopausal transition are partly to blame for the emotional ones. First, Menopause doesn't mean the end is near — you've still got as much as half your life to go. Second, Menopause will not snuff out your femininity and sexuality. In fact, you may be one of the many women who find it liberating to stop worrying about pregnancy and periods. Most important, even though Menopause is not an illness, you shouldn't hesitate to get treatment if you're having severe symptoms. Many treatments are available, from lifestyle adjustments to hormone therapy. How do I recognise it? Technically, you don't actually "hit" Menopause until it's been one year since your final Menstrual period. In Europe, that happens about age 51, on average. The signs and symptoms of menopause, however, often appear long before the one-year anniversary of your final period. They include: Irregular periods Decreased fertility Vaginal dryness Hot flashes Sleep disturbances Mood swings Increased abdominal fat Thinning hair Loss of breast fullness Causes Causes of Menopause include: Natural decline of reproductive hormones Hysterectomy Chemotherapy and radiation therapy Primary ovarian insufficiency How do you treat it? Like any disease, even if there is no cure, there is almost always something you can do to manage it and take control. There are three main areas involved in the treatment of any disease: Conventional medicines Complementary medicines Complementary therapies For information on medicines and therapies relevant to Menopause, make an appointment at Lynch's pharmacy, Broadale, Douglas, Cork on 021-4366923.
