Q: When do I need a tetanus booster?
A: Many programs give a childhood series followed by adult boosters roughly every 10 years. For dirty/high-risk wounds, a booster may be recommended if it’s been more than ~5 years since your last dose. Exact schedules vary—confirm with local immunisation guidelines and your vaccine history.
