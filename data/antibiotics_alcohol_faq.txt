Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking antibiotics?
A: For most antibiotics, light alcohol is unlikely to stop the medicine working, but it can worsen side-effects (drowsiness, nausea, dizziness). Strict avoid: metronidazole and tinidazole (severe reaction), and avoid alcohol for at least 48â€“72 hours after the last dose. Caution with linezolid (interacts with tyramine-rich drinks), and some cephalosporins (e.g., cefotetan). Always read the leaflet and follow local pharmacist/doctor advice.
