Always take Drogenil exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. The tablets should be swallowed with a glass of water. What’s the dose? The usual dose is one tablet three times daily at 8 hour intervals. Could it interact with other tablets?
