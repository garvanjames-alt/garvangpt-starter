Multiple Myeloma is a Cancer of your plasma cells, a type of white blood cell present in your bone marrow. Plasma cells normally make proteins called antibodies to help you fight infections. In Multiple Myeloma, a group of abnormal plasma cells (myeloma cells) multiplies, raising the number of plasma cells to a higher than normal level. Since these cells normally make proteins, the level of abnormal proteins in your blood also may go up. Health problems caused by Multiple Myeloma can affect your bones, immune system, kidneys and red blood cell count. How do I recognise it? Bone pain, particularly in your back, pelvis, ribs and skull. Presence of abnormal proteins — which can be produced by myeloma cells — in your blood or urine. These proteins — which are antibodies or parts of antibodies — are called monoclonal, or M. proteins. Often discovered during a routine exam, monoclonal proteins may indicate Multiple Myeloma, but also can indicate other conditions. High level of calcium in your blood. This can occur when calcium from affected bones dissolves into your blood. If you have a high calcium level in your blood, you may experience signs and symptoms such as: Excessive thirst and urination Constipation Nausea Loss of appetite Mental confusion Causes Although the exact cause isn't known, doctors do know that Multiple Myeloma begins with one abnormal plasma cell in your bone marrow — the soft, blood-producing tissue that fills in the center of most of your bones. This abnormal cell then starts to multiply. How do you treat it? Like any disease, even if there is no cure, there is almost always something you can do to manage it and take control.
