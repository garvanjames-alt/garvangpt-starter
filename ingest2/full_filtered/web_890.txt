At the outset we look at what Peptic Ulcers are, we then consider the causes of Peptic Ulcers, namely Stress and H-Pylori, then the risk factors associated with Peptic Ulcers and finally a selection of treatments available including triple therapy. &nbsp; What is it? Peptic Ulcers are open sores that develop on the inside lining of your stomach, upper small intestine or esophagus. The most common symptom of a Peptic Ulcer is abdominal pain. It wasn't too long ago that lifestyle factors, such as a love of spicy foods or a stressful job , were thought to be at the root of most Peptic Ulcers. Doctors now know that a bacterial infection or some medications — not stress or diet — cause most Peptic Ulcers. How do I recognise it? Burning pain is the most common Peptic Ulcer symptom. The pain is caused by the Peptic Ulcer and is aggravated by stomach acid coming in contact with the ulcerated area. The pain typically may: Be felt anywhere from your navel up to your breastbone Last from a few minutes to several hours Be worse when your stomach is empty Flare at night Often be temporarily relieved by eating certain foods that buffer stomach acid or by taking an acid-reducing medication Disappear and then return for a few days or weeks Causes Although stress and spicy foods were once thought to be the main causes of Peptic Ulcers, doctors now know that the cause of most Peptic Ulcers is the corkscrew-shaped bacterium Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). H. pylori is the most common, but not the only, cause of Peptic Ulcers. Besides H. pylori, other causes of Peptic Ulcers, or factors that may aggravate them, include: Regular use of pain relievers. Smoking . Excessive alcohol consumption. Stress. How do you treat it? Like any disease, even if there is no cure, there is almost always something you can do to manage it and take control.
