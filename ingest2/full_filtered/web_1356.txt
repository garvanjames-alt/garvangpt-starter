They are used for reducing inflammation. What is it used for? Short-term treatment of inflammatory conditions of the eye. Inflammatory conditions of the ear, eg otitis externa. Inflammatory conditions of the nose. How does it work? Betnesol eye, ear and nose drops contain the active ingredient betamethasone, which belongs to a group of medicines known as corticosteroids. They are used for reducing inflammation. Corticosteroids are hormones produced naturally by the adrenal glands that have many important functions, including control of inflammatory responses. Betamethasone is a synthetic corticosteroid that can be adminstered into the eyes, ears or nose to decrease inflammation in these areas. Inflammation occurs as a result of allergy or irritation and is caused by the release of substances that are important in the immune system. These substances cause blood vessels to widen, resulting in the affected area becoming red, swollen, itchy and painful. Corticosteroids work by acting within cells to decrease the release of these substances in a particular area, thereby reducing swelling, redness and itch. How do I use it? The usual dose is 1 or 2 drops put into the eye every one or two hours Once the redness, itching and soreness starts to feel better, apply the drops less often. Tilt the head back Gently pull lower eyelid downwards and outwards Place drops in the gap between the lid and eye (squeeze bottle very gently if necessary) Blink a few times to spread out the drops Repeat for the other eye if needed.
