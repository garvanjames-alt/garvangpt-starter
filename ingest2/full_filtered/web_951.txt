What is it? Cushing's syndrome occurs when your body is exposed to high levels of the hormone cortisol for a long time. How do I recognise it? Symptoms include: Weight gain , particularly around your midsection and upper back Fatigue Muscle weakness Rounding of your face (moon face) Facial flushing Fatty pad or hump between your shoulders (buffalo hump) Pink or purple stretch marks (striae) on the skin of your abdomen, thighs, breasts and arms Thin and fragile skin that bruises easily Slow healing of cuts, insect bites and infections Depression, anxiety and irritability Loss of emotional control Thicker or more visible body and facial hair (hirsutism) Acne Irregular or absent menstrual periods in females Decreased libido Erectile dysfunction in males New or worsened high blood pressure Glucose intolerance that may lead to diabetes Headache Bone loss, leading to fractures over time Causes Your adrenal glands produce cortisol along with other hormones. When there is too much cortisol in your blood over a long period of time you develop cushing's syndrome. Corticosteroids Taking corticosteroids over a long period of time can raise the cortisol levels in your blood enough to cause cushing's. Your body's own overproduction Your body may just produce too much cortisol by itself due to: A pituitary gland tumor. An ectopic ACTH-secreting tumor. A primary adrenal gland disease. How do you treat it? Like any disease, even if there is no cure, there is almost always something you can do to manage it and take control.
