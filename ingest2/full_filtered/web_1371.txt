Why have I been prescribed Bisoprolol? Bisoprolol is used in the treatment of stable heart failure i.e when the heart is not pumping enough blood to meet the body’s needs. How does it work? Bisoprolol belongs to a family of drugs called Beta-Blockers. Beta-blockers cause a relaxation of the muscles of the heart. This helps to lower high blood pressure&nbsp;( hypertension ) and lessens the pains of angina. Beta-blockers also help to keep the heart beating regularly, by blocking the chemicals which make it beat faster, and, after a heart attack (Myocardial infarction) this can protect the heart from further damage. Beta blockers can also have an effect on the lungs so it is important to tell your doctor if you are asthmatic. When and how do I take it? Usually taken once a day. The tablets should be swallowed whole with some water before meals. What’s the dose? Lowest starting dose is 1.25mg daily. This can be increased to a max of 10mg daily. Could they interact with other tablets? Beta blockers may interact with quite a few other drugs: Any other treatment for high blood pressure or irregular heartbeats. This includes water pills (diuretics). Medicines that belong to the group called barbiturates e.g. phenobarabitone, amylobarbitone, quinalbarbitone and butobarbitone. Medicines for diabetes e.g. insulin Medicines for depression or psychological problems e.g. imipramine, chlorpromazine. Indomethacin which can be used to treat rheumatic disease and other disorders of the muscles and skeleton, gout and period pains. Medicines for coughs, colds, hayfever or sinus problems, as these may increase your blood pressure . Medicines that cause muscle relaxation e.g. succinyilcholine. Tubocurarine.
