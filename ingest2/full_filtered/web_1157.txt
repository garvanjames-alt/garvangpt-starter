What treatments for Lung Cancer are available and the management of Lung Cancer. &nbsp; What is it? Lung Cancer is the leading cause of Cancer deaths in Ireland, among both men and women. Lung Cancer claims more lives each year than Colon, Prostate , Ovarian , Lymph and Breast Cancers combined. People who smoke have the greatest risk of Lung Cancer. The risk of Lung Cancer increases with the length of time and number of cigarettes smoked. If you quit smoking, even after smoking for many years, you can significantly reduce your chances of developing lung cancer. How do I recognise it? Lung Cancer typically doesn't cause signs and symptoms in its earliest stages. Signs and symptoms of Lung Cancer typically occur only when the disease is advanced. Signs and symptoms of Lung Cancer may include: A new cough that doesn't go away Changes in a chronic cough or "smoker's cough" Coughing up blood, even a small amount Shortness of breath Chest pain Wheezing Hoarseness Losing weight without trying Bone pain Headache Causes Smoking causes the majority of Lung Cancers — both in smokers and in people exposed to secondhand smoke. But Lung Cancer also occurs in people who never smoked and in those who never had prolonged exposure to secondhand smoke. In these cases, there may be no clear cause of Lung Cancer. Doctors have identified factors that may increase the risk. How do you treat it? Like any disease, even if there is no cure, there is almost always something you can do to manage it and take control. There are three main areas involved in the treatment of any disease: Conventional medicines Complementary medicines Complementary therapies For information on medicines and therapies relevant to Lung Cancer, make an appointment at Lynch's Pharmacy, Broadale, Douglas, Cork on 021-4366923.
