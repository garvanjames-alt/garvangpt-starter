The efficacy of Brintellix was established in six 6 to 8 week studies (including one study in the elderly) and one maintenance study in adults. How does it work? It relieves depression symptoms by increasing serotonin concentrations in the brain, by inhibiting its reuptake in the synapse and by modulating (activating certain receptors while blocking, or antagonizing, others) certain serotonin receptors. This puts it in the class of atypical antidepressants known as serotonin modulators and stimulators. General Instruction for Use The recommended starting dose is 10 mg administered orally once daily without regard to meals. Dosage should then be increased to 20 mg/day, as tolerated, because higher doses demonstrated better treatment effects in trials conducted in the United States. The efficacy and safety of doses above 20 mg/day have not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials. A dose decrease down to 5 mg/day may be considered for patients who do not tolerate higher doses. Contraindications Hypersensitivity to vortioxetine or any components of the formulation. Angioedema has been reported in patients treated with Brintellix. The use of MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders with Brintellix or within 21 days of stopping treatment with Brintellix is contraindicated because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome. The use of Brintellix within 14 days of stopping an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders is also contraindicated. Starting Brintellix in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue is also contraindicated because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.
