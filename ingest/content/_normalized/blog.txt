 Advice on Pfizer&#039;s COVID 19 Vaccine
 
 
 by Garvan
 12 December 20
 Comments
 
 So first: what is a vaccine? a vaccine teaches our immune system how to create antibodies, and it is these antibodies that protect people from disease.

 Your gut microbiome may make it harder for you to lose weight
 
 
 by Garvan
 11 August 19
 Comments
 
 For some people on a diet, the pounds just seem to fall off, while others have a much harder time losing weight. Now, a new, small study finds that people's gut bacteria may play a role in determining how easy, or difficult, it is for them to lose weight.
The study suggests that, among people who have a hard time losing weight, their gut bacteria tend to be better at&nbsp;using carbohydrates,...

 by Garvan

 Comments
 
 Matcha is the finely ground powder of new leaves from shade-grown (90% shade)&nbsp;Camellia sinensis&nbsp;green tea bushes. The tea (and food flavoring) is enjoyed around the world.

 Comments
 
 When it comes to inpatient treatment of a range of mental health and mood disorders -- from anxiety and depression to schizophrenia, suicidality and acute psychotic episodes -- a new study suggest that physical exercise is so effective at alleviating patient symptoms that it could reduce patients' time admitted to acute facilities and reliance on psychotropic medications.
