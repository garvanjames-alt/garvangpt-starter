What is it? Lupus occurs more frequently in women, though it isn't clear why. Four types of lupus exist — Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, Discoid Lupus Erythematosus, Drug-Induced Lupus Erythematosus and Neonatal Lupus. Of these, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus is the most common and serious form of Lupus. The outlook for people with Lupus was once grim, but diagnosis and treatment of Lupus has improved considerably. With treatment, most people with Lupus can lead active lives. How do I recognise it? The signs and symptoms of Lupus that you experience will depend on which body systems are affected by the disease. But, in general, Lupus signs and symptoms may include: Fatigue Fever Weight loss or gain Joint pain, stiffness and swelling Butterfly-shaped rash (malar rash) on the face that covers the cheeks and bridge of the nose Skin lesions that appear or worsen with sun exposure Mouth sores Hair loss (alopecia) Fingers and toes that turn white or blue when exposed to cold or during stressful periods (Raynaud's phenomenon) Shortness of breath Chest pain Dry eyes Easy bruising Anxiety Depression Memory loss Causes Lupus is an autoimmune disease, which means that instead of just attacking foreign substances, such as bacteria and viruses, your immune system also turns against healthy tissue. This leads to inflammation and damage to various parts of the body, including the joints, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, blood vessels and brain. How do you treat it? Like any disease, even if there is no cure, there is almost always something you can do to manage it and take control. There are three main areas involved in the treatment of any disease: Conventional medicines Complementary medicines Complementary therapies For information on medicines and therapies relevant to Lupus, make an appointment at Lynch's Pharmacy, Broadale, Douglas, Cork on 021-4366923.
