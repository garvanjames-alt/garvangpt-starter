Q: What are typical adult doses for paracetamol and ibuprofen?
A: Paracetamol (acetaminophen): 500–1000 mg every 4–6 hours as needed; max 4000 mg in 24 hours (lower max if liver disease, regular alcohol use, or per local guidance). Avoid duplicate paracetamol in combo products. Ibuprofen: 200–400 mg every 6–8 hours with food; OTC max 1200 mg/day (higher doses only on medical advice). Avoid ibuprofen if you have active ulcers, significant kidney disease, certain heart conditions, are on anticoagulants, or in late pregnancy. Follow local guidance and product leaflet.
