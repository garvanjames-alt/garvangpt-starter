What is it? Your heart's beating is controlled by electrical impulses sent from within your heart. These keep it going at a steady pace. A-Fib occurs when these signals are scattered and your heart, and the chambers within your heart, are all out of synch with each other. How do I recognise it? If you have symptoms (and you may not), you may experience some of the following: Palpitations, which are sensations of a racing, uncomfortable, irregular heartbeat or a flopping in your chest Decreased blood pressure Weakness Lightheadedness Confusion Shortness of breath Chest pain Causes In atrial fibrillation , the upper chambers of your heart receive chaotic electrical signals and they quiver. The lower chambers also beat rapidly, but not as fast as the atria. The end result is a fast and irregular heart rhythm. The heart rate in atrial fibrillation may range from 100 to 175 beats a minute. The normal range for a heart rate is 60 to 100 beats a minute. Any of the following could possibly cause A-Fib High blood pressure Heart attacks Abnormal heart valves Congenital heart defects An overactive thyroid or other metabolic imbalance Exposure to stimulants such as medications, caffeine or tobacco , or to alcohol Sick sinus syndrome — improper functioning of the heart's natural pacemaker Emphysema or other lung diseases Previous heart surgery Viral infections Stress due to pneumonia , surgery or other illnesses Sleep apnea How do you treat it?
