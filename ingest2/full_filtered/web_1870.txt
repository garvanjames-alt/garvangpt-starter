Miconazole is an antifungal medicine used to treat infections with fungi and yeasts. What is it used for? Fungal infections of the skin, eg ringworm, candidiasis, athlete's foot, fungal nappy rash, groin infections. Daktarin powder can be used to treat these skin infections in adults and children of all ages. The powder may be used on broken skin and is particularly useful where a drying effect is required. How does it work? Daktarin powder contains the active ingredient miconazole. Miconazole is an antifungal medicine used to treat infections with fungi and yeasts. Miconazole kills fungi and yeasts by interfering with their cell membranes. It works by stopping the fungi from producing a substance called ergosterol, which is an essential component of fungal cell membranes. The disruption in production of ergosterol disrupts the fungal cell membrane, causing holes to appear in it. The cell membranes of fungi are vital for their survival. They keep unwanted substances from entering the cells and stop the contents of the cells from leaking out. As miconazole causes holes to appear in the cell membranes, essential constituents of the fungal cells can leak out. This kills the fungi and treats the infection. Miconazole also has some antibacterial action and kills certain bacteria that may also be present in the infection. How do I use it? Wash and dry the skin thoroughly before applying the powder. The powder should be sprinkled onto the affected area(s) and surrounding skin twice a day (morning and evening). The powder can also be dusted inside clothing, socks or shoes that are in contact with the infected area. You should continue to use the powder for 10 days after all signs of the infection have cleared up. This is to make sure that the infection is fully treated and thus prevent it coming back. If symptoms persist consult your doctor. Warning! Daktarin powder is for external use on the skin only. It should not be taken by mouth or used inside the mouth or nose. Avoid contact with the eyes. Daktarin powder contains talc. Take care to avoid inhaling the powder. Not to be used in Allergy to any ingredient. Daktarin powder should not be used to treat nail infections. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice on treatments if you think your nails are infected. This medicine should not be used if you are allergic to one or any of its ingredients. Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have previously experienced such an allergy. If you feel you have experienced an allergic reaction, stop using this medicine and inform your doctor or pharmacist immediately. Pregnancy and breastfeeding Certain medicines should not be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding. However, other medicines may be safely used in pregnancy or breastfeeding providing the benefits to the mother outweigh the risks to the unborn baby. Always inform your doctor if you are pregnant or planning a pregnancy, before using any medicine. This medicine should be used with caution during pregnancy, and only if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the developing baby. Miconazole is unlikely to be absorbed through the skin in sufficient amounts to affect the baby. However, as with all medicines, you should seek medical advice from your doctor before using this medicine if you are pregnant. Miconazole is unlikely to be absorbed through the skin in significant amounts, however, it is not known if the medicine passes into breast milk. It should be used with caution by breastfeeding mothers, and only if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the baby. As with all medicines, you should seek medical advice from your doctor before using this medicine if you are breastfeeding. If you do use the powder while breastfeeding, you should not apply it to the skin of the breasts before giving a feed, to avoid it being ingested by the nursing infant. Side effects Medicines and their possible side effects can affect individual people in different ways. The following are some of the side effects that are known to be associated with this medicine. Just because a side effect is stated here does not mean that all people using this medicine will experience that or any side effect. Rare&nbsp; Skin irritation at the site of application. Very rare&nbsp; Skin reactions at the application site, for example redness, itching, burning sensation, hives or allergic rash (contact dermatitis). If affected stop using this medicine and consult your doctor. Allergic reactions such as swelling of the face, tongue and throat or anaphylaxis.

For more information about any other possible risks associated with this medicine, please read the information provided with the medicine or consult your doctor or pharmacist. How can this medicine affect other medicines? Tell your doctor or pharmacist what medicines you are already using, including those bought without a prescription and herbal medicines, before you start treatment with this medicine. Similarly, check with your doctor or pharmacist before using any new medicines while using this one, to make sure that the combination is safe. Miconazole is unlikely to be absorbed through the skin in sufficient amounts to affect other medicines that you are taking by mouth. However, if you are taking warfarin to prevent blood clots, there is a very small chance that this medicine may enhance the effect of the warfarin. If you are taking warfarin your doctor may therefore want to monitor your blood-clotting time (INR) during and after a course of this medicine.
