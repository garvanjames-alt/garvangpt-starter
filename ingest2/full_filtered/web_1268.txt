What is Vitamin D's role: Vitamin D through its active form (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) is essential for intestinal Ca absorption and plays a central role in maintaining Ca homeostasis and skeletal integrity In vitamin D deficiency there is a decrease in the concentration of 25(OH) vitamin D (25-hydroxy vitamin D) and an increase of varying degrees in the parathyroid hormone (PTH) level The increased serum PTH stimulates bone turnover, leading to bone loss In periods of protracted vitamin D deficiency, bone loss is increased and this may lead to osteoporosis Features of Vitamin D deficiency: In young children, who have little mineral in their skeleton, vitamin D deficiency results in a variety of skeletal deformities classically known as rickets In adults, the epiphyseal plates are closed and there is enough mineral in the skeleton to prevent skeletal deformities so that this mi neralisation defect, known as osteomalacia, often goes undetected However osteomalacia causes a decrease in Bone Mineral Density (BMD) and is associated with isolated or generalised aches and pains in bones and muscles Recommendations for at risk groups: The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) in 2014 recommended that all babies living in Ireland should be given a vitamin D only supplement providing 5 μg (200 IU) daily vitamin D from birth to 12 months It is expected that the vitamin D needs of other ‘at-risk’ groups, such as pregnant women and children aged 12 months to four years, will be addressed by the FSAI at a later date The National Osteoporosis Society in the UK (NOS) has identified the following adult groups at risk of vitamin D deficiency: All pregnant and breastfeeding women, especially teenagers and young women Older people, aged 65 years and over People who have low or no exposure to the sun, for example those who cover their skin for cultural reasons, who are housebound or who are confined indoors for long periods People who have darker skin, for example people of African, African-Caribbean or South Asian origin, because their bodies are not able to make as much vitamin D How to Take Altavita D3 How to take Altavita D3 Soft Capsules Altavita D3 soft capsules should be swallowed whole with water.
